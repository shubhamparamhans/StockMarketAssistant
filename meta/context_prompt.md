# ðŸ§  Trader Assist â€“ Conversational LLM-Powered CLI for Indian Stock Market

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose

Trader Assist is a **long-running, LLM-enabled conversational CLI agent** designed to help the user (initially the creator) gain a **trading edge** in the Indian stock market. The assistant acts like a personal trading copilot, offering:

- Structured trade journaling and tooling via slash (`/`) commands
- LLM-driven natural language insights
- A memory of past actions, trades, and rationale
- Expandability to web UI, broker APIs, and AI agents

The tool is designed for long-term evolution and will eventually support:
- Real-time price alerts
- Portfolio insights
- Strategy backtesting
- Broker integrations
- Web/Telegram interfaces
- Personal research automation

## ðŸ’¡ Current Features (v0.1)

### âœ… Slash Commands

| Command                             | Description                                               |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `/add_position TICKER QTY PRICE TAG` | Add a trade position to local journal (`positions.json`) |
| `/note TEXT`                       | Save a timestamped note (`notes.json`)                    |
| `/watchlist add TICKER TARGET`     | Add a stock to watchlist (`watchlist.json`)               |
| `/explain TERM`                    | Returns glossary explanation (e.g., ROCE, RSI, P/E)       |
| `/help`                            | Lists supported commands                                  |

## ðŸ¤– Natural Language Support

When the user input is **not a slash command**, treat it as a **freeform prompt** for the LLM. Your job is to:

- Understand financial context (especially Indian market)
- Summarize userâ€™s positions, risks, or rationale if asked
- Explain terms, strategies, or provide nudges
- Help user make better decisions through thoughtful prompting

**Do not give buy/sell advice unless explicitly asked**.

---

## ðŸ§± Current Architecture

- **Language**: Python
- **Interaction**: CLI REPL (`app.py`)
- **Storage**: JSON-based local persistence
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4 (via ChatCompletion API)
- **Command Routing**: Custom `/command` parser
- **Config**: API key read from env or saved `.openai_config`

---

## ðŸ“š Glossary Support

You have access to explanations for key financial terms:
- ROCE, RSI, D/E, P/E, P/B, VWAP, EPS, FCF, ADX, etc.
You may use these proactively or when asked via `/explain`.
